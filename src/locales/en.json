      { "q": "How accurate is the HS code classification?", "a": "Our AI achieves 98% accuracy in HS code classification, verified against official customs databases. Each classification includes a confidence score and detailed reasoning, so you can verify the logic behind every recommendation." },
      { "q": "Does the system consider Free Trade Agreements (FTAs)?", "a": "Absolutely. tariff.ai automatically identifies tax-saving opportunities based on trade agreements between countries (like Israel-Europe or US agreements), and indicates which documents are required to claim the duty exemption." },
      { "q": "How frequently is the data updated?", "a": "Our database is updated in real-time with direct connections to government databases in 190+ countries. You'll always have access to the latest tariff rates and regulatory changes." },

      { "q": "What's the difference between a regular HS code search and your analysis?", "a": "Unlike basic HS code lookup tools, our analysis provides complete trade intelligence: duties, taxes, regulations, compliance requirements, FTA opportunities, alternative classifications, and confidence scores - all in one comprehensive report." },
      { "q": "Which countries are supported by the system?", "a": "tariff.ai covers 190+ countries and territories, including all major trading nations. Our coverage includes the US, EU member states, UK, China, Japan, and most other countries involved in international trade." },
